## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze data from a sales records database for scale model cars and extract information for decision-making. You can download the database file for this project [here](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/600/stores.db). 

From the company's perspective, we have the following questions:
- Question 1: Which products should we order more? Which products should we order less?
- Question 2: How should we adapt marketing to customer behavior?
- Question 3: How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?

## Exploration

We have the following database schema for the scale model cars database:
