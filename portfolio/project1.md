## Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict weather using data from the Dane County Regional Airport (Madison, WI). You can request the [data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search), and view the [documentation](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/daily-summaries/doc/GHCND_documentation.pdf).

I will expand this page, but for now, please view the [jupyter notebook](https://githubmaxds.github.io/portfolio/madison-weather-project/), which you can [download](/portfolio/madison-weather-project.ipynb).
