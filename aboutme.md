title: About Me
subtitle: Mathematics, Physics Undergraduate at University of Wisconsin-Madison
---

I was born and raised in Springfield, OH, where I attended Shawnee High School, and I had the fortune of having excellent teachers, who encouraged me in STEM. Now, I'm a fourth-year undergraduate studying mathematics and physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. While I enjoy pure mathematics, I love real-world, applied problems, not limited to the field of physics, and as such I continue to learn skills in statistics and programming, hoping to find a complementary career. 

As a student, I have learned to use standard scientific software, including LaTeX and MATLAB, and my favorite courses at UW-Madison include Applied Mathematical Analysis, Advanced Physics Laboratory, and Data Science Programming and Modelling. Working, I have experience as a marketing intern, developing promotional video cards and using Microsoft Excel, and I have experience as an undergraduate research assistant, maintaining lab equipment and analyzing data using Python.
